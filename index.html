<h4>
From Today I am going to work hard.
</h4
    <p>I was supposed to summarize more papers in order to finish my literature review part. <br>
         But I was distracted to learn on building personal website. <br>
         My previous attempt is to using Heroku but later I find Github is also convenient. <br>
         It becomes more interesting when you find github provides development mode supporint coding online. <br>
         I feel I am now using a fancy notebook (or maybe diary book).</p>

    Tomorrow is Thanksgiving. Amy invited me to her huge family. She also mentioned she would play football nearby in the morning. <br>
    She knew that I would like to experience full Thanksgiving but she was not sure I was able to get up that early. I am not sure either. <br>
    I prepared European cookie collection for the childrens and brought a classcial American chocolate collection for myself. The chocolate is too sweet...<br>
