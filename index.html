<h4>
    From Today I am going to work hard.
</h4>
    <p>I was supposed to summarize more papers in order to finish my literature review part.
         But I was distracted to lear on building personal website. 
         My previous attempt is to using Heroku but later I find Github is also convenient. 
         It becomes more interesting when you find github provides development mode supporint coding online. 
         I feel I am now using a fancy notebook (or maybe diary book).<br>
        
    Tomorrow is Thanksgiving. Amy invites me to her huge family. She also mentioned she will playing football nearby in the morning. 
    She knows that I would like to experience full Thanksgiving but she was not sure I was able to get up that early. I am not sure either.
